# This is a piece of code that does the following
list = []
#opens a file through fhand
fhand = open('romeo.txt')
#loops through fhand
for row in fhand:
    #strips fhand of the white space on the right side of each line
    row = row.rstrip()
    #splits each line into its each variable in based on a space
    lad = row.split()
    #loops through each word in each row
    for word in lad:
    #if the word is NOT in the variable 'list', then append that word to list
        if word not in list:
            list.append(word)
#sorts each word in list
list.sort()
print(list)
