#4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

def computepay(h, r):
    if h > 40:
        ovthrs = h - 40
        reghrs = 40
        totalpay = (reghrs * r) + (ovthrs * r * 1.5)
    elif h <= 40:
        totalpay = h * r

    return totalpay
while True:
    try:
        h = float(input("Please input total hours: "))
        r = float(input("Please input pay rate: "))
        break
    except:
        print("Please enter valid numbers")
        
print("Pay",computepay(h, r))
